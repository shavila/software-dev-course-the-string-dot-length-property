/*

Objective:
Practice using the .length property by calculating the length of
multiple predefined strings and assigning the results to specific variables.

Instructions:
You will be provided with several predefined string variables.
Your task is to:
  - Use the .length property to calculate the length of each string.
  - Assign the length of each string to its corresponding length variable.
  - Ensure that each length variable contains the correct value.

// Starter Code (Pre-filled):
// Predefined strings
let stringOne = "Coding Bootcamp";
let stringTwo = "JavaScript";
let stringThree = "";

// Your task: Assign the length of each string to the corresponding variable
let lengthOne;   // Length of stringOne
let lengthTwo;   // Length of stringTwo
let lengthThree; // Length of stringThree

// Your code here



lengthOne = stringOne.length;
lengthTwo = stringTwo.length;
lengthThree = stringThree.length;
console.log("Length of stringOne is ", lengthOne);
console.log("Length of stringTwo is :", lengthTwo);
console.log("Length of stringThree is :" , lengthThree);
